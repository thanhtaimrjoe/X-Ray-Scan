# Changelog

## [2026-06-12 11:58] - Flutter environment and app scaffold

**Owner**: AI Assistant
**Type**: Chore
**Scope**: Android/Docs/Release

### Changes
- Installed Flutter stable 3.44.2 at `C:\Users\hanak\development\flutter`.
- Added Flutter SDK `bin` directory to the user PATH.
- Accepted Android SDK licenses through Flutter tooling.
- Scaffolded the initial Flutter app under `app/` with package namespace `com.auren.tapsortrush`.
- Added `flame`, `google_mobile_ads`, and `shared_preferences` dependencies.
- Normalized Android namespace and application ID to `com.auren.tapsortrush`.
- Set the Android display label to `Tap Sort Rush`.
- Updated README, technical spec, and release checklist with verified setup status.

### Details
- File: `app/pubspec.yaml`
- File: `app/android/`
- File: `app/lib/main.dart`
- File: `app/test/widget_test.dart`
- File: `README.md`
- File: `docs/05_technical_spec.md`
- File: `docs/06_release_checklist.md`
- Reason: Prepare the repository for Android mini game implementation and future AdMob integration.
- Decision: Keep Android and web platforms in the Flutter scaffold; Android remains the release target.

### Verification
- [x] `flutter doctor -v`
- [x] `flutter test`
- [x] `flutter build apk --debug`

### Notes
- Flutter doctor still reports Visual Studio missing for Windows desktop development. This is not required for Android builds.
